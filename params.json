My modified sunflow 0.73 is now available as source code [here] (https://github.com/monkstone/sunflow), reqd janino is included [new BSD licence](http://dist.codehaus.org/janino/new_bsd_license.txt). You will need to build the sunflow and joons libraries from source (ant build files are included, in both), so all you need is ant and jdk (you should probably use version '1.6.0\\_43'), but you could import the projects into eclipse or netbeans, or even use jEdit with antfarm plugin. Build sunflow first unless you've already got a binary.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
