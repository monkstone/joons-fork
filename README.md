# joons fork #

Read wiki [here](https://github.com/monkstone/joons-fork/wiki/_pages) 


I've been messing with the joons renderer [gnu gpl3 licence](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt), here is my fork that is modified to work with processing-2.0b8, also as is my preferences uses a modified version of sunflow version 0.73 [MIT licence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) (should work with regular sunflow-0.73 but not sunflow-0.72). My modified sunflow is now available [here] (https://github.com/monkstone/sunflow) include janino [new BSD licence](http://dist.codehaus.org/janino/new_bsd_license.txt). You will need to build the sunflow and joons libraries from source (ant build files are included, in both), so all you need is ant and jdk, but you could import the projects into eclipse or netbeans.
