I'v been messing with the joons renderer, here is my fork that is modified to work with processing-2.0, also as is my preferences uses a modified version of sunflow version 0.73 (should work with regular sunflow-0.73 but not sunflow-0.72). My modified sunflow is adapted to use janino-2.6.1. Everything was compiled against processing-svn (10263)
using jdk-1.6.0_33.
