I've been messing with the joons renderer /<gnu gpl3 licence/>, here is my fork that is modified to work with processing-2.0, also as is my preferences uses a modified version of sunflow version 0.73 /<MIT licence/> (should work with regular sunflow-0.73 but not sunflow-0.72). My modified sunflow is adapted to use janino-2.6.1 /<apache-commons licence/>. Everything was compiled against processing-svn (pre-2.0b4)
using jdk-1.6.0_35.
